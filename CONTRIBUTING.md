Pull requests are awesome!  Pull requests with tests are even more awesome!

## Quick steps

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests: `bundle && rake`
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, it needs a test!
4. Make the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
